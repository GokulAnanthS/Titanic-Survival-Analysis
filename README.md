# Titanic Survival Prediction – EDA & Machine Learning

This repository presents an end-to-end machine learning analysis of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Overview
The objective is to predict passenger survival using demographic, socio-economic, and travel-related features.
The project follows a structured data science workflow with emphasis on interpretability and reproducibility.

## Key Highlights
- Merged train and test datasets for consistent EDA
- Evidence-driven feature engineering (cabin, titles, family structure)
- Visual exploratory analysis
- Baseline and advanced models
- Clear inference and evaluation

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved superior discrimination and was selected for final predictions.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook in the `notebook/` directory
3. Generate Kaggle submission from Section 10
